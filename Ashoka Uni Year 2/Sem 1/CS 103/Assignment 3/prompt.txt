There are three questions in this assignment. Two of them are Arduino
assignments and the third one is a "c" assignment. The Arduino
assignment must be done is groups and the "c" assignment should be
done individually.

For the Arduino questions please upload a single zip file containing
the solution for both the questions. If you have three members in your
team, name the zip file as "lastname1-lastname2-lastname3-arduino.zip".

For the sum program, upload a single zip file with the name
"firstname-lastname-sum.zip".

	\subsection{Question 2}
		Let us start with $n=1$\\
		$3^2=9$ and $2^{3^n} + 1=9$ in which $3^{n+1}$ divides $2^{3^n} +1$\\
		\\
		Let us assume that this is true for $n=k$, that is that a $3^{k+1}$ divides $2^{3^{k +1}} +1$\\
		\\
		For $n=k+1$, we get $3^{k+1+1}=3^{k+1}*3^1$\\
		We also get $2^{3^{k+1}} +1=2^{3^k * 3} +1$\\
		Which can be written as $2^{3^{k+1}} + 1^3$\\
		$=(2^{3^k}+1)(2^{3{^k} +2} +1 -2^{3^k})$\\
		$=(2^{3^k}+1)(3(2^{3^k}) +1)$
	\subsection{Question 3}
		Let us start from $n=1$\\
		$2^1 * 2^1 =4$\\
		If we remove one tile, we are left with 3 tiles in an L-shape. This can easily be filled by 1 tromino.\\
		\\
		Let us assume this is true for $n=k$, that is for a $2^k*2^k$ board, the board can be perfectly covered by trominoes after removing one square from it.\\
		\\
		For $n=k+1$, a $2^{k+1}$ can be split into four boards of $2^k$\\
		We know that we can cover a board of $2^k$ by removing one square. To cover these boards, we would remove one piece each, for a total of 4 pieces.\\
		Of these 4, we can cut it down to 1 piece, by covering the other 3 with a tromino.\\
		\\
		Thus, we can perfectly cover a board of $2^{k+1}*2^{k+1}$\\
		Thus proven.

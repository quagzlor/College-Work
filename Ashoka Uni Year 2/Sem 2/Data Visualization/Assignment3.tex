	My aim in making this vizualisation was to see what the greatest reason for suicide was during the period of 2001-2012.\\
	The data was taken from \href{https://data.gov.in}{Open Government Data}, and was provided by the \href{http://ncrb.gov.in/}{National Crime Records Bureau.}\\
	I processed the data using Excel, condensing it into one sheet, and reducing it to the cause, number of deaths, and year.\\
	I decided to present it as a Gantt graph, to give a neat visualization of what the greatest causes were. I used Tableau to create the graph, in order to allow for interaction, due to the fact that data may become hidden in such a graph.\\
	The observation I made was that the singular largest cause of suicide was due to Bankruptcy, particularly during the year 2001. A search on Google shows that there were a large number of suicides by farmers during that year, who most likely make up the majority of the numbers in 2001.\\
	The graph can be viewed \href{https://public.tableau.com/profile/divij.singh\#!/vizhome/SuicidesPerYearinIndiaSortedbyCauses/Sheet1}{here.}\\

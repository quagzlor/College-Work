	\section{Q1}
As p is prime, and $gcd(a,p = 1)$, $a$ mod $p \in \{1,2...p-1\}$\\
This holds true for $2a, ... (p-1)a$\\\\
Let us suppose there exists an x and y where $1\leq x < y \leq (p-1)$\\
Such that $xa \equiv ya(p)$\\
$\therefore p | a(x-y)$ which means that $p | a(x-y)$ (As $gcd(a,p) = 1$)\\\\
But the fact that $x,y <p$ and $x<y$, meaning that $0 < s-t<p$ which gives us a contradiction.\\\\
Thus, mod p gives us a bijective map between $\{a,2a...(p-1)a \}$ and $ \{1,2...(p-1) \} $\\
$\therefore a^{p-1} \equiv 1$ mod $p$\\

\section{Q2}
$d = gcd(a,b)$\\
Let us assume that the above is false, such that $d \neq a x^{\prime}+b y^{\prime}$\\
Then let $c=\min \{a x^{\prime}+b y^{\prime} : a x^{\prime}+b y^{\prime}>0\}=a x+b y$ for some $x, y$\\
Say $ a =ci + j, 0 < j < a$\\
Then $ci = a-j\\
\therefore i(ax+by) = a - j\\
\therefore j \in \{a x^{\prime}+b y^{\prime} : a x^{\prime}+b y^{\prime}>0\}, j <c$\\
But as c is the smallest positive integer, this is a contradiction.\\\\
Say $c|a$, and similarly $c|b$.\\
Let $a = dk, b = dl$\\
$c = ax + by = d(kx + jy)$ = d\\
But d is the gcd, and $c= ax + by$\\\\
$\therefore d = ax+by$ for integers x and y.

\section{Q3}
We know that F is a field.\\
So, the additive axioms of vector spaces hold in F, as do the multiplicative axioms.\\
As $K \subset F$ the multiplicative axioms hold for any $x \in K$ as well.\\
Thus, F is a vector space over K.

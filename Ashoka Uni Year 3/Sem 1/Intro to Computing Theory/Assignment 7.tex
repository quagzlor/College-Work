(a) Let the received codeword be $r$\\
$r = c + n$, where $c$ is the original codeword, and $n$ is noise.\\
We first multiply $r^{tr}$ with the parity check matrix H, to receive the four digit syndrome.\\
$Hr^{tr} =   0110$\\
We then add the corresponding coset leader to $r$.\\
We receive $01010-11010-01000$ as the decoded codeword.\\\\

(b) We apply the same method as above.\\
$Hr^{tr} = 1010$\\
Decoded codeword: $11100-01100-00111$\\\\

(c) We apply the same method as above.\\
$Hr^{tr} = $\\
Decoded codeword: $11001-11011-11000$

\section{Q2}
The same method as is used for binary Hamming codes can be used for ternary Hamming codes.\\
That is, for an $r \geq 2$, $n = 2^r -1$, $k = 2^r -r -1$, and $d = 3$\\
The same method is used for decoding, where we construct a parity check matrix H. We then get the syndrome of the received vector $r$ from $Hr^{tr}$\\
We then find the corresponding coset leader, and add it to the received vector to find the decoded codeword.

\section{Q3}
A single error correcting code is a perfect code if there is no coset leader with a weight greater than 1.\\
For Hammng code, sin $n = 2^r -1$, there are $n+1=2^r$ vectors for each codeword. The number of codewords is given by $2^k$, which is $2^{2^r -r -1}$ codewords.\\
Multiply the number of codewords by the number of vectors, and you get $ 2^{2^r - r - 1 + r} = 2^{2^r -1} = 2^n$ vectors.\\
Thus, every vector of length $n$ is contained in a codeword, and the code is perfect.

	I worked on all four languages.\\
	Out of all the four languages, I found Python to be the easiest to use, and Rust the hardest.\\
	Python automatically handle many of the processes I would have to explcitly define in C, C felt like I was building many of the system I took for granted in other languages, while Rust and Go both felt like odd mixes of the first two.\\
Due to the size of the arrays, I did not notice any appreciable difference in speed.
